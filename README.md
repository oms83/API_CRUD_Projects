# API_CRUD_Projects

## 1. List-Based CRUD Operations
This project demonstrates CRUD operations using a simple in-memory collection (List<T>).

### Purpose:
To showcase CRUD functionalities without the use of a database. Ideal for lightweight applications or as an initial step before connecting to a data source.

### Technologies Used:
C#, ASP.NET Core, RESTful API

## 2. Database-Based CRUD Operations (Three-Tier Architecture)
This project demonstrates CRUD operations with a database as the data source, utilizing a three-tier architecture (Presentation Layer, Business Logic Layer, and Data Access Layer).

### Purpose:
To illustrate the separation of concerns and how a three-tier architecture can be implemented in .NET applications.

### Technologies Used:
C#, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, SQL Server

## 3. Database-Based CRUD Operations (T-SQL and Three-Tier Architecture)
This project demonstrates CRUD operations using T-SQL for direct database manipulation, integrated with a three-tier architecture for clean separation of logic.

### Purpose:
To showcase the use of T-SQL in complex database operations within a structured architecture.

### Technologies Used:
C#, ASP.NET Core, T-SQL, SQL Server, Three-Tier Architecture
